# Coordinate System Quadrant Identifier

A Python program that identifies the quadrant or axis position of coordinates in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system.

## Program Description
This interactive program takes user-input coordinates (x, y) and determines their position:
- Which quadrant (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th)
- Whether they lie on X-axis, Y-axis, or at the origin
- Continues processing coordinates until user enters (0, 0)

## Features
- Interactive coordinate input system
- Real-time quadrant identification
- Axis detection (X-axis, Y-axis, origin)
- Continuous operation until termination condition
- Formatted floating-point output

## How to Run
```bash
python coordinate_identifier.py

Enter x and y(press space in between the numbers): 3.5 -2.1
Enter x and y: 3.50   -2.10
==> (3.50, -2.10) is below X-axis
==> It is at forth quadrant

Enter x and y(press space in between the numbers): 0 0
Enter x and y: 0.00   0.00
==> (0.00, 0.00) is at origin
